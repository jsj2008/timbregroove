============

This project is in 100% churn mode - that is: total, ground up rewrite can happen
at any time. Much is what is in the project as of this writing is a learning expirment. 
This is my first Objective-C app, my first iOS app, my first native OpenGL app. 'Nuff said.

Current version gotchas are mainly around un-obvious magic.
-- menus.plist that house much policy 
-- fmod libs are linked via .xconfig files b/c no other method worked
-- swipe right/left after adding modules
-- pinch to play in "daw mode"
-- some menu items crash the app (fnab)
-- nothing can be deleted
-- everything is super, super ugly
-- read the last line again
-- the todo/feature list is much, much too long to go into
