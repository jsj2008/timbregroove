============

This project is in 100% churn mode - that is: total, ground up rewrite can happen
at any time. Much is what is in the project as of this writing is a learning expirment. 
This is my first Objective-C app, my first iOS app, my first native OpenGL app, my
first real-time processing app, my (almost) first audio processing app. 'Nuff said.

If I had to guess, I would say about 50% of this code might survive.

Current version gotchas are mainly around un-obvious magic.
- config.plist that house much policy 
- many of the visual 3d elements have not been run in a long time (which is to say: they are broken)
- the app IS prone to crash if you push too many doo dads
- many doo dads are visual only, no nothing happens when you click on the bunny.
- everything is super, super ugly
- read the last line again
- the todo/feature list is much, much too long to go into
